# jellyfin-rffmpeg-docker
A Docker container implementation of Jellyfin with rffmpeg 


Based heavily on both the Jellyfin project and its Docker container (https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin)
and on rffmpeg by joshuaboniface (https://github.com/joshuaboniface/rffmpeg)

Please note that I will provide some basic how-to but in the original rffmpeg repo there's an in-detail description about how rffmpeg works
